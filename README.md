# ZXSpectrumChuckieEgg
Fully documented, reverse engineered source code to AnF's ZX Spectrum classic Chuckie Egg

## Preamble

Chuckie Egg was a classic, and highly addictive Spectrum platform game released in 1984 and written by a 17 year old Nigel Alderton.  The game was published by the Manchester based A'n'F software. 

The game was one of the first ZX Spectrum titles with pixel based sprite movement (previously graphics moved one character, or 8 pixels, at a time due to the screen layout of the Spectrum).

## Assembling the Game 

The source code has been put together for SJAsmPlus and should assemble and generate a snapshot file right out of the box.  The code has a few added extras in there for disabling things like the speech (for the Fuller Orator) and the music (which drove me nuts!)  There's also a couple of EQUates you can set to disable collisions and make it so you only need to collect one egg to move on a level.  It is more or less identical to the game that shipped in 1984 other than I removed any left over, unused data and a few snippets of the original source code that were left behind in the original release.
