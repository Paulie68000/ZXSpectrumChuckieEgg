Fully documented, reverse engineered source code to AnF's ZX Spectrum classic Chuckie Egg

## Preamble

Chuckie Egg was a classic, and highly addictive Spectrum platform game released in 1984 and written by a 17 year old Nigel Alderton.  The game was published by the Manchester based A'n'F software. 

The game was one of the first ZX Spectrum titles with pixel based sprite movement (previously graphics moved one character, or 8 pixels, at a time due to the screen layout of the Spectrum).
